# SwiftOpenCL

This repo was forked from [damien's repo](https://github.com/damienpontifex/SwiftOpenCL) and contains a working Xcode 9.2 project in Swift 4.

A swift wrapper around OpenCL inspired the C++ object wrapper.

Interfacing with C libraries from Swift is a pain. Alongside this, the OpenCL library is quite verbose to setup a working environment. This is the start of a Swift wrapper around the OpenCL API.
